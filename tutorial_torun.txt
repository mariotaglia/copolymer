File name: kais.001.001.dat kais.001.002.dat etc
Description: geometric dependency of 1-1 interactions, 1-2 interactions, etc. Should be added if flagkai is 0.

File name: fort.100 
Description: densitysolvent of the first case. Should be added if infile is 1.

File name: fort.101 fort.102 etc
Description: densitypolymer001 densitypolymer102 etc of the first case. Should be added if infile is 1.

File name: structure.in
Description: a text file with 2 columns. The first column indicates which type is each segments. The second column indicates which type of charge has each segment. Poor solvent segments are 1, 2, 3, etc. Hydrophilic segments are 0. Usually 1 indicates tail segments and 2 indicates linker segmentes.
