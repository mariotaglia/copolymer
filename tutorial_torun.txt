File name: DEFINITIONS.txt
Description: see example in main directory. Mandatory.

File name: kais.001.001.dat kais.001.002.dat etc
Description: geometric dependency of 1-1 interactions, 1-2 interactions, etc.
Depends on curvature, dimR, Xulimit and dimf. If any of those parameteres
changes, it has to be recalculated. Should be added if flagkai is 0.

File name: fort.100 
Description: initial guess for solvent volume fraction. Should be added if infile is 1.

File name: fort.101 fort.102 etc
Description: initial guess for volume fraction of bead 1, 2, etc. If Ncomp > 1,
fort.101 is the sum of the volume fraction of bead 1 from all the compounds.
Shold be added if infile is 1.

File name: fort.200
Description: initial guess for electrostatic potential. Should be added if
infile is 1.

File: epsilon.in
Description: matrix with inter bead interactions. It can be generated
automatically by the martini_to_theory python script from martini parameters.
Mandatory.

File name: structure.001.in structure.002.in etc
Description: these files indicate the structure of compounds 1, 2, etc. The
file contains three columns. Each line of the file indicates poorsv type,
acid type and basic type of each bead. The number of lines should coincide
with long. Branches go at the end ordered as in DEFINITINOS.txt (see example
in main directory). Mandatory.

Example (long=8, npoorsv=2, Nacids=1, Nbasics=0):

1	0	0
1	0	0
1	0	0
1	0	0
2	0	0
